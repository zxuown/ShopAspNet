## Getting Started

To start using this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred code editor.
3. Configure your database settings if necessary.
4. Build and run the project.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can access it via your web browser. Here's how to use each feature:

- **Home Page:** The navigation bar at the top includes links to the Home, Categories, and Profile pages. On this page, you'll find a lookbook showcasing products, including images, titles, and prices. You can also filter products by category, such as "All," "Dresses," "Bags," or "Shoes." Clicking on a product image will take you to the product page. The Profile section displays the user's name and admin status (if applicable). There's also a bell icon in the navigation bar that leads to the shopping cart.

- **Categories Page:** Clicking on the "Categories" link allows you to choose a category. Once selected, you'll see the category's page with its respective products. Clicking on a product image will display it in a separate window. You can sort products by price in ascending or descending order.
